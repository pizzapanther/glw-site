God called me to the mission field 23 years ago. I have been involved with another orphanage for 23 years under the direction of Pastor Jean Romain. The moment I put my foot on Haitian soil, God filled my heart with compassion for the poor and suffering. He told me to plead the cause of the poor according to Proverbs 31:9. With Godâ€™s help and the help of the Holy Spirit, I will do that.

In 2011, after many years of working with others in Haiti, the Lord led me to start a new orphanage. God has given me many opportunities to share his word and help the poor. He amazes me that he would choose an ordinary woman and home maker to minister forth his word. I count it an honor and a privilege that I could be a part of helping suffering children.

Sincerely,
Arlene Bailey
