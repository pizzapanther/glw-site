Dear Friends, Family, and Fellow Believers,

We are coming to the end of another year, and we are praising God for what he has done and what he is going to do. Even though we have been through many difficulties this year, God has brought us through in spite of everything. We believe He is with us and guiding us each step of the way.

We have 14 children now at the orphanage. They all seem to be doing well right now. Some of them were sick for a while, but they are all well now.  Thanks to Haiti Lifeline Ministries the children were all checked by American doctors for free. They were all tested for HIV and were all OK. One of the children has a heart murmur so please keep him in prayer, that God will heal him.

We want to take the time to thank God and all that have supported us in prayers and donations. We would not have made it without your help. God bless you all, we appreciate the support. We are going to send out a sheet of our expenses so you will see how your donations are being used. We still don’t take in enough to meet our needs. So please pray and if you know someone who would like to support us, please pass on the news. More information about the orphanage is available on our website, www.godlovedtheworld.com.

Again we thank everyone for all your help. We are trusting God that the New Year will be glorious, full of joy, peace, and goodwill to all men. We are praying always that Jesus’s light will shine in this world of darkness.We are not just here to build an orphanage, but we are here to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost and dying world.


God Bless you all, Merry Christmas and have a glorious New Year.
Evangelist & Missionary,
Arlene Bailey
