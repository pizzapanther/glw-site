<p>
	My name is Evangelist Arlene Bailey; I am writing this to share the vision God has placed on my heart.&nbsp; We are believing God to start an orphanage in Haiti.&nbsp; The name we have chosen for the ministry is <em><strong>God So Loved The World Ministries (John 3:16), Haiti Missions and Orphanage</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
	God called me to the mission field 23 years ago.&nbsp; I have been involved with another orphanage for 23 years under the direction of Pastor Jean Romain.&nbsp; The moment I put my foot on Haitian soil, God filled my heart with compassion for the poor and suffering.&nbsp; He told me to plead the cause of the poor according to <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2031:9&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank">Proverbs 31:9</a>.&nbsp; With God&rsquo;s help and the help of the Holy Spirit, I will do that.</p>
<p>
	Also, I believe he has called me to preach according to Luke 4:18,<em>&nbsp;&quot;The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor&quot;</em>.&nbsp; In the beginning of the journey most of the time I ministered in song and testified in the churches.&nbsp; As my relationship grew strong in the Lord, God told me that I was to preach.&nbsp; At first I had a hard time to believe that.&nbsp; But my faith and confidence grew stronger and God gave me the courage to minister his word.&nbsp; Also, Pastor Romain saw the call on my life and he ordained me in 2006.</p>
<p>
	God has given me many opportunities to share his word.&nbsp; God amazes me that he would choose an ordinary woman and home maker to minister forth his word.&nbsp; I count it an honor and a privilege that I could be a part of helping suffering children.</p>
<p>
	The needs to help start the orphanage are listed below. &nbsp;Please see our <a href="/pages/donate">donation page</a> to make donations to help start the orphanage, or feel free to <a href="/pages/about">contact me</a> at anytime for more information.</p>
