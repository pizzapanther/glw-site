	On September 7th I traveled to Haiti with the expectation that our rented house would be ready, and that we would be able to take in children. &nbsp;We have several children who are currently living in the mountains that are potential candidates for living in the orphanage. &nbsp;However, when I arrived the electricity and the water were not hooked up. &nbsp;Part of the contract for the rental was that these utilities would be hooked up by September. &nbsp;For the water, a well was drilled but the pump was not big enough. &nbsp;For the electricity, a transformer is needed.</p>
<p>
	Until these utilities are hooked up, we can not take children in. &nbsp;I decided to come back to the US to try and raise money, so we can start taking in children. &nbsp;Before the end of the year, we are looking to raise approximately $2,000 for the water and electricity and $5,000 for supplies, worker salaries, food, and medical treatments for the first children. &nbsp;Please see our <a href="/pages/donate">donation page</a> to make a donation or <a href="/pages/about">contact me directly</a>.</p>
<p>
	We were able to make some progress in other areas. &nbsp;We purchased bunk beds, mattresses, a stove, and a freezer. &nbsp;Once the house is ready, we should be able to take in 6 children. &nbsp;Lastly, we have interviewed and chosen several people to work at the orphanage, and they are ready to start as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
	Thank you for your support and keep the orphanage in your prayers. &nbsp;Pray that God&#39;s will be done.</p>
