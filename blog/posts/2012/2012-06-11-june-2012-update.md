<p>
	Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; I wanted to give you an update on my recent trip to Haiti.&nbsp; I returned to Haiti on May 2nd, 2012 for three weeks.&nbsp; When I last left Haiti we only had 2 children, but we were expecting more.&nbsp; When I arrived at the orphanage I was greeted by 5 children, two girls and three boys!</p>
<p>
	The first day, they seemed a little shy, but it didn&rsquo;t take them long for them to warm up. We really seemed to bond.&nbsp; I love them very much, and I believe they love me as well.&nbsp; They call me &ldquo;Ma Ma Arlene&rdquo;, and when I wake up in the morning they come running to hug and greet me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We need to get the children in school by September.&nbsp; We visited a Christian school, and the principal said she would allow us to bring all five children for $1000 for the year!&nbsp; So if any of you would like to sponsor a child for $25 a month that would take care of the books and uniforms.&nbsp; You are more than welcome to sponsor more than one child.&nbsp; We would also love to send you a picture of the child this way you can pray for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We are still in need of financial support for food, rent, workers salaries, and the list goes on.&nbsp; We appreciate all the help whether it be a one time offering or monthly support.&nbsp; Most of all, we need your prayers and encouragement!</p>
<p>
	We want to say a huge thank you to all of you who have helped us with financial support and the many prayers.&nbsp; We will do our best to use the money wisely and use it for what it is needed.&nbsp; We will be able to take in more children as we get more beds and financial support.&nbsp; We are taking it slow for this is a new work.&nbsp; Plus, God told me not to despise small beginnings.&nbsp; We are believing God that we will be able to take in 20-25 children in time.&nbsp; One step at a time, one day at a time.&nbsp; Praise God!</p>
<p>
	After I returned from Haiti, I received devastating news; that all the children were sick and had contracted Typhoid Fever.&nbsp; We were able to get them medical care; they are being treated and are recovering nicely.&nbsp; The doctors said that &ldquo;within the month they should be well.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, please keep them in your prayers.&nbsp; Pray that they will be completely healed, thank you for that!</p>
<p>
	God also gave me another opportunity to preach.&nbsp; In one of the services 2 people were saved! Glory be to God!&nbsp; We are rejoicing over what God is doing in Haiti.&nbsp;</p>

	God Bless,<br />
