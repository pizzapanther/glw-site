<p>
	Dear friends, family, and fellow believers,</p>
<p>
	Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; We wanted to give you an update on our last trip to Haiti.&nbsp; We were in Haiti during the month of February and March.&nbsp; My husband was with me for two weeks and I stayed for five weeks.<br />
	We finally started the orphanage.&nbsp; We have three boys and are expecting three or four more in April.&nbsp; We are praising the Lord for his help and faithfulness to us.&nbsp; Two of the boys came out of a tent city, and we are so happy to be able to give them a better life.&nbsp; I really thought they would have a hard time adjusting because during their first day they seemed bewildered.&nbsp; However, they quickly adjusted and seem to be happy.</p>
<p>
	There are three other people helping me with the orphanage, Pastor Romain, Mama Florence and Fransy.&nbsp; They are a blessing and a big help.&nbsp; They take care of the children and run the orphanage when I&rsquo;m not there.&nbsp; Sometimes I can not pay them, yet they are still willing to work.&nbsp; We are believing God for steady support to help pay their salaries and run the orphanage.</p>
<p>
	This has been one of the most difficult things I have ever done in my life, but by God&rsquo;s Grace we will make it.&nbsp; Because of the bad state of the country, we don&rsquo;t always have electricity, and for a while we didn&rsquo;t have water at the house.&nbsp; Initially, we were going two miles everyday for water.&nbsp; During this last trip we were able to buy pipes and a hand pump to have water at the house.&nbsp; We still have to bring buckets of water in the house, but it is a blessing to have water available on the property.</p>
<p>
	Right now we are renting the house for $4,500 a year.&nbsp; The rent is paid until September, and we need to raise money for rent to continue staying in the house. The landlord wants to sell the house, so we are believing God that we will be able to purchase it.&nbsp; The landlord is asking $160,000 for the house.&nbsp; To build an orphanage it would take about $500,000, so it would truly be a blessing to be able to purchase the home.&nbsp; We could hold about 20-25 children there, and there are three rooms in the back to house workers and missionaries.&nbsp; The worker&rsquo;s quarters are in need of repair, but will be nice once finished.</p>
<p>
	During this last trip God gave me the opportunity to minister three times.&nbsp; I always count it an honor and a privilege for the chance to minister God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; We also visited Children&rsquo;s Life Line (<a href="http://childrenslifeline.com/">http://childrenslifeline.com/</a>).&nbsp; We met Donald Curtis (President of Children&rsquo;s Life Line), and he graciously provided us with food for the orphanage.</p>
<p>
	We are grateful for your prayers and anything God puts on your heart to give.&nbsp; If you would like to receive newsletter updates of the ministry please send us your address or sign up for our e-mail newsletter at <a href="/pages/newsletter">http://www.godlovedtheworld.com/pages/newsletter</a></p>
