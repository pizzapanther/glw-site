Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. On my recent trip to Haiti in October, we found all the children well and happy. We told you in the last newsletter, we were starting a school. When I arrived in Haiti, 3 classrooms were all ready for the children and operating under the direction of Pastor Jean Romain. We hired 3 teachers at a salary of $300 a month. I was amazed and blessed to see how nice the classrooms turned out. Pastor Romain has done a wonderful job and we are thankful for him. We are still in need of support for the orphanage and now for the teachers also. Please keep us in your prayers, that we will get the additional help needed.

Because it was unusually hot, I came home early. The heat really got to me; it took me a week to recuperate. About 3 weeks after I got home, Pastor Romain called me to tell me 3 of the children came down with a fever. Some kind of sickness was breaking out and even killing some. One of the children had ended up in the hospital with Malaria. Then two more children came down with the fever along with Pastor Romain who ended up in the hospital too. They are all well now thanks to God and all the prayers of the saints. We need to keep on praying for the rest of the children. It's been a trying few months, but in spite of everything, we are praising God and moving on.

Again, as usual we want to thank all that support us financially and in prayers. We wouldn't be able to do this without God and your help. May you continue to keep us in your prayers, that we might continue to fulfill God's plans for Haiti in helping the poor and orphans. May God richly bless you, keep you, and let his light shine upon you.

God Bless, 
Evangelist & Missionary,
