Dear friends, family and fellow believers,

We just wanted to give you an update on what is happening in Haiti.  We want to give you a Praise Report of what God has done and is doing.  In our last newsletter we were in need of $7,000 for rent, teacher's salaries, worker's salaries, and the electric bill.  Also, Pastor Romain needed an operation that would cost $3,000; which we did not have. 

We can not praise the Lord enough and we thank God for those who have responded to our needs in Haiti.  Someone blessed Pastor and paid for his operation.  The operation went well and he is recuperating nicely.  Also, God blessed us with another $3,000 to pay the teachers and back salaries.  So we are rejoicing much in all that God has done.  Also, I had to have an operation in August and, praise God, I made it through and I am feeling better.   Because of the operation I wasn't able to travel back to Haiti in September.  However, Diane Shepherd went down in my place and I thank God for that. She has been a blessing to us and a real help.  

We are still in need of about $3,500 to catch up on our rent in Haiti and our electric bill.  Also, we are still in need of monthly supporters.  So, if God would place it on your heart to give , we surely would appreciate it.  We are trusting the Lord for His provisions, that we might continue to His work in Haiti and that the people of Haiti will know how much God loves and cares for them.  May we be His hands extended, touching them with the love of Jesus, that they will come to know Jesus as their Savior. 

God Bless,<br>
