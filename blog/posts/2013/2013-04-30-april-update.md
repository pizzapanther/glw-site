	Dear friends, family and fellow believers,</p>
<p>
	Just a little update on what is happening in Haiti.&nbsp; On my recent trip to Haiti in March, we found everyone doing well considering the condition of the country.&nbsp; The children were off from school for a few weeks.&nbsp; My friend Jackie came with me to Haiti for a week.&nbsp; It was her first trip to Haiti.&nbsp; I think she was somewhat shocked to see how back the conditions were in Haiti.</p>
<p>
	We were really blessed to be there at that time for we accepted 3 more children into the orphanage.&nbsp; Three boys from the mountains who were living in extreme poverty.&nbsp; They seemed a little frightened when they first arrived.&nbsp; The other children hugged them and welcomed them.&nbsp; Within a few days they were laughing and playing.&nbsp; We are believing God to have 10 children or more by then end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We are in need of prayers and support.&nbsp; We want to thank those who do pray for us and support us financially.&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t for God and your help we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do what we are doing.&nbsp; We give glory to God for all He has done and is doing!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We want to give a special thanks to Dominion Church of League City, TX who has blessed us with $2500 for a new generator!&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t tell you how much we appreciate their help.&nbsp; For the days and nights in Haiti are very hot.&nbsp; There are times we do not have electricity to run the fans.&nbsp; Of course we still need gas to run the generator.&nbsp; But we are trusting that if God provided the generator, we think He will provide the gas!</p>
<p>
	I had to return home earlier than I wanted too.&nbsp; I had to have an operation on my stomach.&nbsp; So Lord willing everything will turn out okay.&nbsp; Everything went well, I had the operation and am doing fine. &nbsp;I&#39;m praying that I will return to Haiti sometime in June.&nbsp; Keep us in your prayers.</p>
<p>
	God Bless You All!<br />
	Yours in Christ,<br />
	Evg. Arlene Bailey</p>
