<p>
	Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Well, we made it through another year by the grace of God.&nbsp; We have had our share of problems, but God brought us through each one.</p>
<p>
	We want to give you an update on what is happening in Haiti at the orphanage.&nbsp; We are very blessed to have five children.&nbsp; It is a small start, but God told me not to despise small beginnings.&nbsp; They all are going to school, and they are doing very well.&nbsp; Our oldest girl, Gavarianne, has made first in her class at school, and our oldest boy, Miyaguy, is second in his class.&nbsp; We are encouraged and blessed to know that the children are doing well.&nbsp; We are happy that we are able to give them a better life.&nbsp; I believe this is what Jesus would want us to do.</p>
<p>
	We are believing God to take in five or more children by the end of this year.&nbsp; We are still in need of much support (for example, we need more beds and mattresses).&nbsp; But in spite of everything we seem to make it.&nbsp; The workers are paid very little, and I would like to increase their salaries.&nbsp; We thank them so much for their sacrificial giving.&nbsp; Also, I want to thank all those who have given throughout the year: our monthly supporters, and the ones who have given us one-time donations.&nbsp; And most of all, those that have given their time in prayer.&nbsp; Without God, prayer, and financial support, we would have never made it.</p>
<p>
	We would like to give you a praise report.&nbsp; We did not know how we were going to pay the rent in January.&nbsp; And, of course, God is always on time.&nbsp; Just as I was ready to leave for Haiti, $2,500 came in; just enough to finish paying the rent for the year!&nbsp; Also we received a nice sum of money from the Authentic Church which helped us pay for the rest of the school year for the children.&nbsp; The Jeep broke down, but we were able to fix it.&nbsp; The well needed some repairs, and we were able to fix that also.&nbsp; Praise God, from whom all blessings flow!</p>
<p>
	Since I was not able to be in Haiti for Christmas, we celebrated Christmas on January 11th.&nbsp; We had a party, we put up a tree, and the workers received presents.&nbsp; They were so happy, and we had a joyful time in the Lord!&nbsp; Also, someone gave us money for a TV.&nbsp; The children had been asking me for one, but I told them Mommy had to think about feeding them first.&nbsp; So again, I thank God for everyone that has given something to bless the children and the workers.</p>
<p>
	For all that have given monetarily, we will be sending you a tax deductible receipt for 2012.</p>
<p>
	God Bless,<br />
