On my recent trip to Haiti in October, we found all the children well and happy. We told you in the last newsletter, we were starting a school. When I arrived in Haiti, 3 classrooms were all ready for the children and operating under the direction of Pastor Jean Romain. We hired 3 teachers at a salary of $300 a month. I was amazed and blessed to see how nice the classrooms turned out. Pastor Romain has done a wonderful job and we are thankful for him. We are still in need of support for the orphanage and now for the teachers also. Please keep us in your prayers, that we will get the additional help needed.</p>

<p>Because it was unusually hot, I came home early. The heat really got to me; it took me a week to recuperate. About 3 weeks after I got home, Pastor Romain called me to tell me 3 of the children came down with a fever. Some kind of sickness was breaking out and even killing some. One of the children had ended up in the hospital with Malaria. Then two more children came down with the fever along with Pastor Romain who ended up in the hospital too. They are all well now thanks to God and all the prayers of the saints. We need to keep on praying for the rest of the children. It's been a trying few months, but in spite of everything, we are praising God and moving on.</p>

<p>Again, as usual we want to thank all that support us financially and in prayers. We wouldn't be able to do this without God and your help. May you continue to keep us in your prayers, that we might continue to fulfill God's plans for Haiti in helping the poor and orphans. May God richly bless you, keep you, and let his light shine upon you.</p>

<p>God Bless, <br>

Greetings in the name of the our Lord Jesus Christ. I haven't written a newsletter lately; time seems to just fly by. The children are well and happy. They have finished another school year this June and it was a miracle all the children were able to go to school. God supplied enough money for all of them to go, but we are in need of funds for the upcoming school year which starts in September. Between the tuition, books, and uniforms it costs us about $5000 - $6000 to send them to school for the year. Of course that is for all 14 children and we need to raise that money before September. So please keep us in your prayers.</p>

<p>We want to take the time to thank God and all the people that support us. For the one time gifts and all the prayers that have gone up for us, our hearts are full of gratitude and appreciation. Also we want to thank Pastor Greg and Dominion Church for the help and support they have given us throughout the year. We also are thankful for Shane and Christy who came to visit us in Haiti and for the 6 bunk beds Dominion Church bought for the orphanage. Now all the children have a bed to sleep in and they don't have to double up.</p>

<p>We ask you continue to pray for us because we are still in need of a vehicle. We did not have to move since the landlord fixed the pump for us, and we have water now. We still have to carry buckets into the orphanage, but at least we have water on the property. We are still in need of supporters. We receive about $1400/month and are monthly expenses are about $2500. So it is a miracle how we make it through. Only by the grace of God do we make it daily. If God would lead you to help us, we would be grateful for any amount of support.</p>

<p>We are coming to the end of another year, and we are praising God for what he has done and what he is going to do. Even though we have been through many difficulties this year, God has brought us through in spite of everything. We believe He is with us and guiding us each step of the way.</p>

<p>We have 14 children now at the orphanage. They all seem to be doing well right now. Some of them were sick for a while, but they are all well now.  Thanks to Haiti Lifeline Ministries the children were all checked by American doctors for free. They were all tested for HIV and were all OK. One of the children has a heart murmur so please keep him in prayer, that God will heal him.</p>

<p>We want to take the time to thank God and all that have supported us in prayers and donations. We would not have made it without your help. God bless you all, we appreciate the support. We are going to send out a sheet of our expenses so you will see how your donations are being used. We still don’t take in enough to meet our needs. So please pray and if you know someone who would like to support us, please pass on the news. More information about the orphanage is available on our website, <a href="http://www.godlovedtheworld.com">www.godlovedtheworld.com</a>.</p>

<p>Again we thank everyone for all your help. We are trusting God that the New Year will be glorious, full of joy, peace, and goodwill to all men. We are praying always that Jesus’s light will shine in this world of darkness.We are not just here to build an orphanage, but we are here to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost and dying world.</p>

<p>God Bless you all, Merry Christmas and have a glorious New Year.<br>

    Dear Friends, Family, and Fellow Believers,</p>

<p>
    We would like to give you an update of everything that has been happening in Haiti for the past few months. We have been through many trials and tribulations and are almost at the brink of giving up. But in my heart even though we have been through much, I don’t believe God wants us to give up.</p>

<p>
    After I left Haiti in May, all the children and staff came down with <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/">chikungunya</a> fever. Several people in our area died of the fever. Only by the grace of God our children and staff were spared. Also this set us back financially.  Because of the added expense, we couldn’t pay the rent for three months on the orphanage. Even when everything is running better we still don’t have enough to run the orphanage daily. We take in a little under a thousand dollars a month and our expenses run over two thousand dollars a month. So our staff doesn’t get paid the full amount they deserve and the rent hasn’t been paid. We also lost our vehicle because we couldn’t afford to fix it any more, so now we are without a vehicle. Also last month, one of the children got deathly sick and ended up in the hospital. The doctors thought he had tuberculous, but after several tests and four days in the hospital, he is back home and doing well. But again, it was an added expense, and it put us behind even more.</p>

<p>
    The school term will be starting in September and we need anywhere between 3000-3500 dollars to send the kids to school for the year.  This figure includes the price of tuition, books, and uniforms for our eleven children to attend a Christian school for the year. We have the option to send them to public school for less, but the public schools are not good in Haiti so the extra cost is worth it for the kids to get a better education and to be taught the Word of God.</p>

<p>
    Also we have not had any water at the orphanage for over eight months. Right now we are buying water which has been a real hardship on our workers who have to carry buckets of water for 15 people into the orphanage for baths and toilets. As long as we don’t pay the rent, the landlord doesn’t have money to fix the well. We have already spent over two thousand dollars to fix the well and can’t afford to do that anymore.</p>

<p>
    If you can help in any way, we would appreciate it greatly. Please, if anything keep us in your prayers. God Bless you all and we hope the next newsletter will bring you some good news. To give to the orphanage visit <a href="/pages/donate">http://www.godlovedtheworld.com/pages/donate</a>, or you can send a check to the address below.</p>

    Dear Friends, family, and fellow believers,</p>

<p>
    Greetings in the name of the our Lord Jesus Christ.  I can’t believe another year has gone by. We are in operation and moving ahead by the grace of God. It’s been a real trying year, but we believe God is with us and that He has helped us through each day and every situation.</p>

<p>
    We want to give you an update on what is happening in Haiti at the orphanage. We now have eleven children and we are expecting to take more in the future. We have nine children that are going to school.  There are two girls that can’t go to school for a lack of funds.  But they all seem very happy and content. It is a joy to know these children are not suffering any longer, and they are in a safe place and eating.</p>

<p>
    We had a team come down in December from Dominion Church, Kacey, Aaron, Misty, and Paul. They were such a blessing and an encouragement to us all. They brought Christmas presents for all the children, clothes, and other supplies. We gave the kids a little party and Christmas stockings before Christmas, while the team was there. They took time to play and just be with the children. We all hope they will come back again.  We want to thank the Pastor and all the people of Dominion Church who gave to make Christmas possible.</p>

<p>
    Also Bill Glidden came for a week who is also from Texas. He did some needed work around the orphanage. We also were very blessed to have him there. He took time to pray with us which really touched my heart.</p>

<p>
    I would again like to thank those who have given throughout the year, both those that give regularly and one time givers. And of course we also thank those who have given of their time in prayer. We would have never made it without God, prayer, and financial support.</p>

<p>
    We ask that you continue to pray for us. We are in need of a vehicle since our jeep broke down. It needed so many repairs that we felt it would be too much to fix it, and so we no longer have it.  Also we need to move from the house we are in because the well went dry and we have no water. Our neighbor has been giving us water but we can’t keep on getting water this way. So we are looking for another house to rent that has running water. We are still in need of supporters. We have gained some, but it is still not enough to take care of our needs. If God would lead you to help us we would be grateful.</p>

    Dear friends, family and fellow believers,</p>

<p>
    Just a little update on what is happening in Haiti.  On my recent trip to Haiti in March, we found everyone doing well considering the condition of the country.  The children were off from school for a few weeks.  My friend Jackie came with me to Haiti for a week.  It was her first trip to Haiti.  I think she was somewhat shocked to see how back the conditions were in Haiti.</p>

<p>
    We were really blessed to be there at that time for we accepted 3 more children into the orphanage.  Three boys from the mountains who were living in extreme poverty.  They seemed a little frightened when they first arrived.  The other children hugged them and welcomed them.  Within a few days they were laughing and playing.  We are believing God to have 10 children or more by then end of the year. </p>

<p>
    We are in need of prayers and support.  We want to thank those who do pray for us and support us financially.  If it wasn’t for God and your help we wouldn’t be able to do what we are doing.  We give glory to God for all He has done and is doing! </p>

<p>
    We want to give a special thanks to Dominion Church of League City, TX who has blessed us with $2500 for a new generator!  We can’t tell you how much we appreciate their help.  For the days and nights in Haiti are very hot.  There are times we do not have electricity to run the fans.  Of course we still need gas to run the generator.  But we are trusting that if God provided the generator, we think He will provide the gas!</p>

<p>
    I had to return home earlier than I wanted too.  I had to have an operation on my stomach.  So Lord willing everything will turn out okay.  Everything went well, I had the operation and am doing fine.  I'm praying that I will return to Haiti sometime in June.  Keep us in your prayers.</p>

<p>
    God Bless You All!<br>
    Yours in Christ,<br>
    Evg. Arlene Bailey</p>

    Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Well, we made it through another year by the grace of God.  We have had our share of problems, but God brought us through each one.</p>

<p>
    We want to give you an update on what is happening in Haiti at the orphanage.  We are very blessed to have five children.  It is a small start, but God told me not to despise small beginnings.  They all are going to school, and they are doing very well.  Our oldest girl, Gavarianne, has made first in her class at school, and our oldest boy, Miyaguy, is second in his class.  We are encouraged and blessed to know that the children are doing well.  We are happy that we are able to give them a better life.  I believe this is what Jesus would want us to do.</p>

<p>
    We are believing God to take in five or more children by the end of this year.  We are still in need of much support (for example, we need more beds and mattresses).  But in spite of everything we seem to make it.  The workers are paid very little, and I would like to increase their salaries.  We thank them so much for their sacrificial giving.  Also, I want to thank all those who have given throughout the year: our monthly supporters, and the ones who have given us one-time donations.  And most of all, those that have given their time in prayer.  Without God, prayer, and financial support, we would have never made it.</p>

<p>
    We would like to give you a praise report.  We did not know how we were going to pay the rent in January.  And, of course, God is always on time.  Just as I was ready to leave for Haiti, $2,500 came in; just enough to finish paying the rent for the year!  Also we received a nice sum of money from the Authentic Church which helped us pay for the rest of the school year for the children.  The Jeep broke down, but we were able to fix it.  The well needed some repairs, and we were able to fix that also.  Praise God, from whom all blessings flow!</p>

<p>
    Since I was not able to be in Haiti for Christmas, we celebrated Christmas on January 11th.  We had a party, we put up a tree, and the workers received presents.  They were so happy, and we had a joyful time in the Lord!  Also, someone gave us money for a TV.  The children had been asking me for one, but I told them Mommy had to think about feeding them first.  So again, I thank God for everyone that has given something to bless the children and the workers.</p>

<p>
    For all that have given monetarily, we will be sending you a tax deductible receipt for 2012.</p>

We can always use your support, but specifically right now we are looking to send the kids to school at a cost of $25/month for each child.  And as always any additional support will go to food, rent, worker salaries, etc.  </p>

    Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  I wanted to give you an update on my recent trip to Haiti.  I returned to Haiti on May 2nd, 2012 for three weeks.  When I last left Haiti we only had 2 children, but we were expecting more.  When I arrived at the orphanage I was greeted by 5 children, two girls and three boys!</p>

<p>
    The first day, they seemed a little shy, but it didn’t take them long for them to warm up. We really seemed to bond.  I love them very much, and I believe they love me as well.  They call me “Ma Ma Arlene”, and when I wake up in the morning they come running to hug and greet me. </p>

<p>
    We need to get the children in school by September.  We visited a Christian school, and the principal said she would allow us to bring all five children for $1000 for the year!  So if any of you would like to sponsor a child for $25 a month that would take care of the books and uniforms.  You are more than welcome to sponsor more than one child.  We would also love to send you a picture of the child this way you can pray for them. </p>

<p>
    We are still in need of financial support for food, rent, workers salaries, and the list goes on.  We appreciate all the help whether it be a one time offering or monthly support.  Most of all, we need your prayers and encouragement!</p>

<p>
    We want to say a huge thank you to all of you who have helped us with financial support and the many prayers.  We will do our best to use the money wisely and use it for what it is needed.  We will be able to take in more children as we get more beds and financial support.  We are taking it slow for this is a new work.  Plus, God told me not to despise small beginnings.  We are believing God that we will be able to take in 20-25 children in time.  One step at a time, one day at a time.  Praise God!</p>

<p>
    After I returned from Haiti, I received devastating news; that all the children were sick and had contracted Typhoid Fever.  We were able to get them medical care; they are being treated and are recovering nicely.  The doctors said that “within the month they should be well.”  But, please keep them in your prayers.  Pray that they will be completely healed, thank you for that!</p>

<p>
    God also gave me another opportunity to preach.  In one of the services 2 people were saved! Glory be to God!  We are rejoicing over what God is doing in Haiti. </p>

        <p>
    Dear friends, family, and fellow believers,</p>

<p>
    Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  We wanted to give you an update on our last trip to Haiti.  We were in Haiti during the month of February and March.  My husband was with me for two weeks and I stayed for five weeks.<br>
    We finally started the orphanage.  We have three boys and are expecting three or four more in April.  We are praising the Lord for his help and faithfulness to us.  Two of the boys came out of a tent city, and we are so happy to be able to give them a better life.  I really thought they would have a hard time adjusting because during their first day they seemed bewildered.  However, they quickly adjusted and seem to be happy.</p>

<p>
    There are three other people helping me with the orphanage, Pastor Romain, Mama Florence and Fransy.  They are a blessing and a big help.  They take care of the children and run the orphanage when I’m not there.  Sometimes I can not pay them, yet they are still willing to work.  We are believing God for steady support to help pay their salaries and run the orphanage.</p>

<p>
    This has been one of the most difficult things I have ever done in my life, but by God’s Grace we will make it.  Because of the bad state of the country, we don’t always have electricity, and for a while we didn’t have water at the house.  Initially, we were going two miles everyday for water.  During this last trip we were able to buy pipes and a hand pump to have water at the house.  We still have to bring buckets of water in the house, but it is a blessing to have water available on the property.</p>

<p>
    Right now we are renting the house for $4,500 a year.  The rent is paid until September, and we need to raise money for rent to continue staying in the house. The landlord wants to sell the house, so we are believing God that we will be able to purchase it.  The landlord is asking $160,000 for the house.  To build an orphanage it would take about $500,000, so it would truly be a blessing to be able to purchase the home.  We could hold about 20-25 children there, and there are three rooms in the back to house workers and missionaries.  The worker’s quarters are in need of repair, but will be nice once finished.</p>

<p>
    During this last trip God gave me the opportunity to minister three times.  I always count it an honor and a privilege for the chance to minister God’s word.  We also visited Children’s Life Line (<a href="http://childrenslifeline.com/">http://childrenslifeline.com/</a>).  We met Donald Curtis (President of Children’s Life Line), and he graciously provided us with food for the orphanage.</p>

<p>
    We are grateful for your prayers and anything God puts on your heart to give.
